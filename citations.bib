  abstract  = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems have a huge potential both in terms of data rate and energy efficiency, although channel estimation becomes challenging for a large number of antennas. Using a physical model allows to ease the problem by injecting a priori information based on the physics of propagation. However, such a model rests on simplifying assumptions and requires to know precisely the configuration of the system, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper we present mpNet, an unfolded neural network specifically designed for massive MIMO channel estimation. It is trained online in an unsupervised way. Moreover, mpNet is computationally efficient and automatically adapts its depth to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method we propose adds flexibility to physical channel models by allowing a base station (BS) to automatically correct its channel estimation algorithm based on incoming data, without the need for a separate offline training phase. It is applied to realistic millimeter wave channels and shows great performance, achieving a channel estimation error almost as low as one would get with a perfectly calibrated system. It also allows incident detection and automatic correction, making the BS resilient and able to automatically adapt to changes in its environment.},

  abstract        = {Massive MIMO systems are highly efficient but critically rely on accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station in or-der to determine appropriate precoders. CSI acquisition requires sending pilot symbols which induce an important overhead. In this paper, a method whose objective is to determine an appropriate precoder from the knowledge of the userâ€™s location only is proposed. Such a way to determine precoders is known as location based beamforming. It allows to reduce or even eliminate the need for pilot symbols, depending on how the location is obtained. the proposed method learns a direct mapping from location to pre-coder in a supervised way. It involves a neural network with a specific structure based on random Fourier features allowing to learn functions containing high spatial frequencies. It is assessed empirically and yields promising results on realistic synthetic channels. As opposed to previously proposed methods, it allows to handle both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels.},

  abstract        = {Channel charting is an unsupervised learning method that aims at mapping wireless channels to a so-called chart, preserving as much as possible spatial neighborhoods. In this paper, a model-based deep learning approach to this problem is proposed. It builds on a physically motivated distance measure to structure and initialize a neural network that is subsequently trained using a triplet loss function. The proposed structure exhibits a low number of parameters and clever initialization leads to fast training. These two features make the proposed approach amenable to on-the-fly channel charting. The method is empirically assessed on realistic synthetic channels, yielding encouraging results.},

  abstract  = {This paper provides an overview of the most recent advancements and outcomes of the European 6G flagship project Hexa-X, on the topic of in-network Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). We first present a general introduction to the project and its ambitions in terms of use cases (UCs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and key value indicators (KVIs). Then, we identify the key challenges to realize, implement, and enable the native integration of AI and ML in 6G, both as a means for designing flexible, low-complexity, and reconfigurable networks (learning to communicate), and as an intrinsic in-network intelligence feature (communicating to learn or, 6G as an efficient AI/ML platform). We present a high level description of down selected technical enablers and their implications on the Hexa-X identified UCs, KPIs and KVIs. Our solutions cover lower layer aspects, including channel estimation, transceiver design, power amplifier and distributed MIMO related challenges, and higher layer aspects, including AI/ML workload management and orchestration, as well as distributed AI. The latter entails Federated Learning and explainability as means for privacy preserving and trustworthy AI. To bridge the gap between the technical enablers and the 6G targets, some representative numerical results accompany the high level description. Overall, the methodology of the paper starts from the UCs and KPIs/KVIs, to then focus on the proposed technical solutions able to realize them. Finally, a brief discussion of the ongoing regulation activities related to AI is presented, to close our vision towards an AI and ML-driven communication and computation co-design for 6G.},

  abstract      = {Channel charting (CC) consists in learning a mapping between the space of raw channel observations, made available from pilot-based channel estimation in multicarrier multiantenna system, and a low-dimensional space where close points correspond to channels of user equipments (UEs) close spatially. Among the different methods of learning this mapping, some rely on a distance measure between channel vectors. Such a distance should reliably reflect the local spatial neighborhoods of the UEs. The recently proposed phase-insensitive (PI) distance exhibits good properties in this regards, but suffers from ambiguities due to both its periodic and oscillatory aspects, making users far away from each other appear closer in some cases. In this paper, a thorough theoretical analysis of the said distance and its limitations is provided, giving insights on how they can be mitigated. Guidelines for designing systems capable of learning quality charts are consequently derived. Experimental validation is then conducted on synthetic and realistic data in different scenarios.},
